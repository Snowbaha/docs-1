# Installation

Snaplet can be run using `npx` from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), or installed and run as a standalone binary:

<Tabs items={["npx", "curl"]}>
  <Tab>
  ```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
  # Set up Snaplet with npx
  npx snaplet setup
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
  # Set up Snaplet as a static binary
  curl -sL https://app.snaplet.dev/get-cli/ | bash
  snaplet setup
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
