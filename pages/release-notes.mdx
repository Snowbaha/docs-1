# Release notes
*The latest Snaplet product updates from the Snaplet team.*


<Steps>
  <Step>
## 19 January 2024 - v0.83.1
### Bug Fixes
Addressed an issue with row estimates in partitioned tables. Previously, Snaplet incorrectly estimated total rows to copy as 0 for partitioned tables with data. This fix ensures accurate handling and data management for such tables, particularly when not using subsetting.
  </Step>
  <Step>
## 17 January 2024 - v0.83.0

### Improvement: `data` parameter for generate function

We now provide a way to access data already generated for a particular model with the `data` parameter:

```
await snaplet.users([{
  email: ({ data }) => `${data.first_name}${data.last_name}@example.org`.toLowerCase()
}])
```

For more, check out [our docs](/core-concepts/seed#data).

### Improvement: `store` and `$store` parameters for generate and connect functions
For both generating fields, as well as connecting up relations, we now provide:
* `store`: The store containing models already created in this plan
* `$store`: The global store containing all models created in this `snaplet` instance so far.

```
// generate function
await snaplet.customers([{
  email: ({ store, $store }) => /* ... */
}])

// connect function
await snaplet.reservations([{
  customer: ({ store, $store }) => /* ... */,
}]);
```

For more, check out our docs:
* [Generate function docs](/core-concepts/seed#store)
* [Connect function docs](/core-concepts/seed#store-2)

### Improvement: Further future-proofing for usage with jest
`0.82.1` solved some issues for using `@snaplet/seed` with jest, this release adds further such improvements to help prevent these same issues appearing in the future

### :warning: **BREAKING CHANGES in `@snaplet/seed`**
We've removed the `modelSeed` parameter that we pass to generate functions in favor of the new `data` mentioned above.

Previously, if you had a field with a value that depended on another field, `modelSeed` provided a way to accomplish this:

```
// **before**
await snaplet.users([{
  createdAt: ({ modelSeed }) => copycat.dateString(modelSeed),
  updateAt: ({ modelSeed }) => {
    const createdAt = copycat.dateString(modelSeed)
    const updatedAtMs = Number(new Date(createdAt)) + 60_000
    return new Date(updatedAtMs).toISOString()
  }
}])
```

Since we now have the `data` parameter, we have a more natural way of obtaining the value generated for previous values:

```
// **after**
await snaplet.users([{
  createdAt: ({ seed }) => copycat.dateString(seed),
  updateAt: ({ data }) => {
    const updatedAtMs = Number(new Date(data.createdAt)) + 60_000
    return new Date(updatedAtMs).toISOString()
  }
}])
```
  </Step>
  <Step>
## 16 January 2024 - v0.82.1
### Changes and Improvements

1. **Improved Restore Functionality for Supabase Users**
   - **Fix:** We've resolved an issue where automatic resets were not properly applied when restoring to `127.0.0.1`. Supabase users can now experience a smoother and more reliable restoration process.

2. **Enhanced CLI Transformations**
   - **Enhancement:** Our CLI has been refined to provide better automatic transformations for fields such as AGE, RATING, and ROLE. This enhancement aims to streamline your data handling and improve overall workflow efficiency.

3. **Jest Environment Compatibility**
   - **Fix:** The use of SnapletClient within the Jest testing environment has been fixed. This update ensures a more seamless integration and compatibility, enhancing your development and testing processes.

Stay tuned for more updates!

## 15 January 2024 - v0.82.0

#### 🚨 BREAKING CHANGES in `@snaplet/seed`

We've made improvements to our AI model to improve some the data we generate to more closely match your production database.

This means that when running `snaplet generate`, the same field (column in a table) might now have a different default value generated for it compared to before `snaplet generate` was run.

After upgrading, subsequent runs of `snaplet generate` afterwards will *not* cause different values to be generated though - just the first `snaplet generate` after the upgrade.

In this context, a default value means a value that was not explicitly given to `@snaplet/seed` for a field (column in a table).

For example:

```ts
// name given explicitly
await snaplet.users({ name: 'Garnet Harley' })

// name not given explicitly
// => the generated value might have now changed
// (after the first `snaplet generate` after upgrading)
await snaplet.users({})
```
  </Step>
<Step>
## 11 January 2024 - v0.81.0

This is a big one for `@snaplet/seed`! 🌱

🚨 **Breaking Changes**

**1. Stateful data client**

The `SnapletClient` is now stateful, meaning that it holds global seeds so you can execute multiple plans generating different data.

This now works:
```ts
await snaplet.users((x) => x(2));
await snaplet.users((x) => x(2));
```

You can clear the state of the client using the new `snaplet.$reset` function.

**2. Global and local stores**

Stores are now first class citizens!

Each plan executed returns the data it produced as a local store.

```ts
const usersStore = await snaplet.users((x) => x(2))
// { users: [user, user] }
console.log(usersStore)
```

A new **global** store is introduced as part of the client's state, accessible at `snaplet.$store`. This store contains all the data generated so far. You can reset its state as part of `snaplet.$reset()`.

**3. Fine-grained auto connections**

We reworked the `autoConnect` feature. The option is renamed to simply `connect` and accepts either `true` or a store. When using `true`, it will connect the plan to what was already generated in the global store.

Before:
```ts
await snaplet.$pipe([
  snaplet.organizations(x => x(2)),
  snaplet.users(x => x(10), { autoConnect: true })
]);
```

Now:
```ts
await snaplet.organizations(x => x(2));
// the 10 users will be automatically connected to one of the 2 previously generated organizations contained in snaplet.$store
snaplet.users(x => x(10), { connect: true });
```

You can also pass a store:
```ts
const externalStore = { users: [{ id: 42 }, { id: 5432 }]} };
await snaplet.posts(x => x(3), { connect: externalStore });
```

**4. Operators `pipe` and `merge` are gone** 🫡

Due to the changes above, the operators are now obsolete and gone. 👋

  <Step>
## 11 January 2024 - v0.80.0
#### Bugfixes
##### Import `@snaplet/copycat` in `seed.mts` example
In the case of`@snaplet/seed`, `npx snaplet setup` now also adds `@snaplet/copycat` as a dependency to your project. The example `seed.mts` file we generate as part of `npx snaplet setup` now also includes an import to `@snaplet/copycat`. Since `@snaplet/copycat` is typically used as part of writing a seed script with `@snaplet/seed`, this change saves you needing to jump through these unnecessary hoops.

#### Improvements
##### Handle invalid `system-manifest.json` files gracefully
We keep some internal state in a file called `system-manifest.json`. For different reasons, this file might be corrupt. This shouldn't prevent you from using Snaplet though, so we now recover from this case gracefully.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  ## 5 January 2024 - v0.78.3
##### Fix `Missing semicolon` error in `snaplet setup` and `snaplet generate`
For some databases, we had an issue preventing generating  the assets needed by `@snaplet/seed`.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  ## 4 January 2024 - v0.78.1
  #### `@snaplet/copycat` BREAKING CHANGE NOTICE
**What is changing?**
Inputs for `copycat.float()` will now map to a different output. It is still deterministic - the same input will always map to the same output. It is just that after the upgrade the corresponding output for each input will have changed.

**When will the change happen?**
We are planning on releasing the change on **23 January 2024** at 12:00pm (noon) UTC

**Who will be affected?**
You might be impacted by this change if:
* If you use snapshots, and you used `copycat.float()` in your `transform` configuration: https://docs.snaplet.dev/core-concepts/capture#transform-data
* If you use `@snaplet/seed`, and you have floating-point column types (e.g. `float4`) in a table for which you use `@snaplet/seed` to generate data

**Why is it changing?**
Previously, output values for `copycat.float()` would stay close to the `min` value given. With this release, output values will distribute more evenly across the (min, max) range of values.

**How to prepare:**
To preview the impact of this change, you can modify your `copycat` import in your configuration.
From: `import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat'`
To: `import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat/next'`.

If you are using `@snaplet/seed`, you'll also need to first update your snaplet dependencies:
```
yarn up snaplet @snaplet/seed
```

Then use the `--copycat-next` flag when regenerating assets:

```
# to switch to `@snaplet/copycat/next`
npx snaplet generate --copycat-next

# to switch back to `@snaplet/copycat`
npx snaplet generate
```

**Need More Time?**
If the scheduled update time doesn’t suit your schedule, please let us know. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause and are here to assist with a smoother transition. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
  </Step>

  <Step>
  ## 4 January 2024 - v0.78.0
  #### Alpha release of `snaplet fingerprint`**
This release adds some of the basics for a feature we're working on called `snaplet fingerprint`.

A new command has been added:
```
snaplet fingerprint <database-url>
```

When run, `snaplet fingerprint` will inspect the database url given (typically this would be a production database url), collect some statistical details from a sample of data in your database, and store them in a `.snaplet/fingerprint.json` file. When running a seed script (e.g. `npx tsx seed.mts`), `@snaplet/seed` will try read from this file - if it exists, it will use it to generate data that is more closely matching the kind of data you have in your production database.

The data it generates is still entirely fake - it will just now be closer to how your production data looks. For example, if a date column, `snaplet fingerprint` would find the minimum and maximum values from a sample of the data, which in turn allows `@snaplet/seed` to generate data within this same date range.

**note** This still is an experimental feature - docs, improvements and much more coming soon!
  </Step>

  <Step>
  ## 4 January 2024 - v0.77.4
  #### Allow using `@snaplet/copycat/next` with `@snaplet/seed`**

We preview upcoming breaking changes in copycat by exporting the latest change for the upcoming copycat release as `@snaplet/copycat/next`.

If you are using `@snaplet/seed`, you can now pass a `--copycat-next` flag when regenerating assets so that these generated assets use `@snaplet/copycat/next`:

```
# to switch to `@snaplet/copycat/next`
npx snaplet generate --copycat-next

# to switch back to `@snaplet/copycat`
npx snaplet generate
```
  </Step>
  <Step>
  ## 31 December 2023 - v0.77.3

  #### Fix `faker is not defined`
When generating the assets required for `@snaplet/seed` (which we do as part of b oth `snaplet setup` and `snaplet generate`), we were accidentally referencing `faker` when generating the default value for fields that we detected as being having the shape of a URL or a MAC address.

We now replaced these cases with the copycat equivalent to avoid referencing faker.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  ## 14 December 2023 - v0.77.0

#### 🚨 **BREAKING CHANGES in** `@snaplet/seed`

We've made improvements to some of the default values we generate for each field (column). We regenerate these defaults each time `snaplet setup` or `snaplet generate` is run.

This means that after upgrading, when running `snaplet generate`, the same field (column in a table) might now have a different default value generated for it compared to before `snaplet generate` was run. Subsequent runs of `snaplet generate` afterwards will *not* cause different values to be generated though - just the first `snaplet generate` after the upgrade.

In this context, a default value means a value that was not explicitly given to `@snaplet/seed` for a field (column in a table).

For example:

```
// name given explicitly
snaplet.users({ name: 'Garnet Harley' })

// name not given explicitly
// => the generated value might have now changed
// (after the first `snaplet generate` after upgrading)
snaplet.users({})
```

#### 🐛 **Bug fixes**

`process` **types in** `seed.mts`
At the moment, the `seed.mts` example generated by `snaplet setup` references `process`. If the projects does not have `@types/node` as a dependency, vscode will show that it does not know about any types for `process`. This releases fixes this by having  `@snaplet/seed` now depends on and references `@types/node` for type definitions. This means that any new projects will get all the type definitions needed for the generated `seed.mts` example, even if they do not have `@types/node` as a dependency**.**

`snaplet.$resetDatabase()` **now respects** `select` **in** `snaplet.config.ts`

If you chose to exclude some schemas or tables in `snaplet.config.ts` with `select`, `snaplet.$resetDatabase()` will now exclude them, and truncate all the remaining tables of the remaining schemas in your database:

```
// snaplet.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet'
export default defineConfig({
  select: {
    public: {
      $default: true,
      _prisma_migrations: false
    }
  }
})
```

```
// seed.mts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed'
const snaplet = new SnapletClient()
// `_prisma_migrations` table will be left as-is and not be truncated
await snaplet.$resetDatabase()
```

**Fix** `Unhandled error: column "<name>" does not exist`

During `snaplet setup` or `snaplet generate`, we collect information from your database in order to generate the assets needed for `@snaplet/seed`. There was a bug in these flows that was sometimes causing us to look up the incorrect column name.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  ## 30 November 2023 - v0.76.0
  #### 🌟 New Features

**Snaplet Generate becomes `@snaplet/seed`**: You can now use the full power of Snaplet Seed everywhere in your codebase! Here is a sneak peek:

```ts
// seed.mts
import { SnapletClient } from "@snaplet/seed";

const snaplet = new SnapletClient();

await snaplet.users(x => x(3, () => ({
  posts: (x) => x(10)
})));
```

To know more about `@snaplet/seed`, read our [quick start guide](https://docs.snaplet.dev/getting-started/quick-start/seed).

#### 🚨 Breaking change in 'snaplet generate'

With the publishing of `@snaplet/seed`, there is no more `generate.run` function in the Snaplet configuration file.

The `snaplet generate` command is repurposed to generate the code needed to use `@snaplet/seed`.

You can follow this migration guide: https://docs.snaplet.dev/migrations/seed#from-0760-and-above

 Thank you for being a part of our journey! 💚
  </Step>
  <Step>
  ## 7 November 2023 - v0.74.0

  #### 🚨 Breaking change: Preview databases

  **Preview Database Handling Overhaul.**  We've revamped how we handle preview databases. It's crucial that if you're using preview databases that you upgrade your Snaplet CLI to the latest version to ensure compatibility. Run `snaplet upgrade` to upgrade.

  </Step>
  <Step>
  ## 7 November 2023 - v0.73.1

  #### 🛠️ CLI improvements

  This version introduces several fixes to enhance your command-line interface experience.

  **Restoration Behavior on Interruption**: If you press Ctrl+C during a restoration prompt, it defaults to a 'no' response to continue the restoration process without interruption.

  **Integer Collision Generation**: The `generate` command has been improved to produce a larger number of values with very low conflict probabilities.

  **Snapshot Support in PDB Creation**: We've made it easier to identify early on if a snapshot won't restore successfully into a preview database by marking unsupported snapshots during PDB creation.

  </Step>
  <Step>
  ## 2 November 2023 - v0.73.0

  #### 🚨 Generate seeds breaking change

  We've made a change to the way Snaplet generates seeds, which breaks previous data generations. We previously introduced a hash based on the plan's inputs to our seeding mechanism, but after user feedback, it's clear that it's not the right approach. The issue with this approach is that if you alter your plan, the modification will impact all the models involved in the plan. As such, we've decided to roll it back.

  If you're interested in the specifics, read on.

  Let's take this example:

  ```ts
  await snaplet.users([
    { name: 'John' }, // user id will be 42
    { name: 'Jane' }, // user id will be 59
    { name: 'Bob' }, // user id will be 14
  ])
  ```

  If you add an email to `Bob`, the user ids will change for all the users:

  ```ts
  await snaplet.users([
    { name: 'John' }, // user id will be 98
    { name: 'Jane' }, // user id will be 35
    { name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@acme.com' }, // user id will be 74
  ])
  ```

  This is because the seeds injected to each field generate functions which were constructed like this:

  `<hash of the plan inputs>/0/users/0/id`

  Now that we removed the hash, a field's value is entirely dependent on the model's location in the plan (basically its path):

  `0/users/0/id`

  So altering your plans will no longer impact the other models and fields ouputs.

  It unfortunately means that your generated data output will change with this release.

  #### 🚨 Alias strategy is now opt-in

  We recently introduced [aliases](/core-concepts/generate#customizing-the-snaplet-data-client-with-aliases) to customize the data client.

  At the time we shipped this feature, we also decided to apply a default alias strategy to the data client. Based on feedback we've decided to revert this change and make it opt-in instead so it's more predictable for you. This is also a breaking change.

  To opt-in, you now need to set the `inflection` option to `true`:

  ```ts
  defineConfig({
    generate: {
      alias: {
        inflection: true,
      },
    },
  });
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step>

  ## 31 October 2023 - v0.72.0

  #### 🛠️ Copycat improvements

  You can't scramble an omlette without breaking some eggs 🍳. We've made improvements to [@snaplet/copycat](https://github.com/snaplet/copycat) that introduce breaking changes with how Copycat "scrambles" data during transformation:

  * For the same input column value from your database, new snapshots will now be have different resulting values compared to what they used to be in previous snapshots.
  * Snaplet generate will generate values that are different to what they used to be.

  What this means is that if your tests were expecting to see deterministic values from your Copycat changes, these tests may break, as Copycat generates new deterministic values for all transformations. As such, this new improvement gets a 🚨 breaking change 🚨 flag.

  We've made this change in part to improvement the performace of Copycat, and so, the good news is if you've experienced slow snapshot captures in the past when capturing large column values, you may see an improvement in the time it now takes for your snapshots to capture.

  Capturing snapshots or generating with Snaplet will still be deterministic though! The data will only change with the next snapshot you capture or the next time you generate data - after which point it will remain the same across as long as the inputs do not change.

  If you rely on Snaplet generating data or transforming data that does not change if the inputs do not change, this release might affect you. More specifically, this change will affect you if you are:

  * Using "auto"-transform mode (if you have transform: `{ $mode: 'auto' }` in your Snaplet configuration as shown in the Data Editor on app.snaplet.dev).
  * Using Copycat in your Snaplet configuration to generate data or transform data when capturing snapshots.
  * Using our generate feature.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  ## October 30 2023 - v0.71.0

  #### 🐛 Snapshot capture bug fix

  We squashed a long-standing bug 🐛 which impacts the snapshot files format for users using older versions of the Snaplet CLI.

  If you captured a snapshot with a version of Snaplet CLI prior to 0.71.0, you can either:

  Capture a new snapshot, which will save it to the new fixed format (recommended):

  `npx snaplet@latest snapshot capture`

  Or run the restore command with the last version of Snaplet CLI before the fix:

  `npx snaplet@0.70.1 snapshot restore`

  As this is a 🚨 breaking change 🚨 we added a notice in the console when running `snaplet snapshot restore` pointing to this [migration note](https://docs.snaplet.dev/migrations/snapshot#from-0710-and-above).

  *If you're having trouble with this change, come ask us for help on [Discord](https://app.snaplet.dev/chat).*
  </Step>
  <Step>
  ## 25 October 2023 - v0.70.0

  #### 🧹 Removing deprecated commands

  Out with the old! In this release we wave goodbye to the following deprecated commands:

  👋 snaplet snapshot subset

  👋  snaplet subset command

  👋  snaplet config setup

  Note that the removal of the above commands is is a 🚨 breaking change.

  #### 🎁 New feature - JSDoc comments

  We added JSDoc comments everywhere in the data client so it's easier to discover its API and understand the options and your database schema.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  ## 23 October 2023 - v0.69.0

  #### 🎁 New feature - Introducing aliases

  We are super excited to introduce a new configuration option for Generate called **`alias`**, which allows you to take full control over how your models, fields and relationships are named. We shipped a sensible default implementation which should cover the majority of the use cases but if you need more customization, you can!

  The default rules for the aliases:

  * Model names: pluralized and camelCased.
  * Scalar field names: camelCased.
  * Parent field names (one to one relationships): singularized and camelCased.
  * Child field names (one to many relationships): pluralized and camelCased.

  Docs: https://docs.snaplet.dev/core-concepts/generate#customizing-the-snaplet-data-client-with-aliases

  Don't forget to update your types after you have updated the CLI by running:

  `snaplet config generate`

  #### 🛠️ Aliases strategy applied by default

  With the introduction of alias above, and we will apply a default strategy so the client's code looks better and is easier to reason about.

  If you want to opt-out, you can by setting the new inflection option to `false`:

  ```
  /// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
  import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';

  export default defineConfig({
    generate: {
      alias: {
        inflection: false,
      },
      async run(snaplet) {
        await snaplet.User((x) => x(3))
      },
    },
  });
  ```

  #### 🧹 Removal of the object form shortcut for one-to-many relationships -

  We've changed the signature for one-to-many relationship, we removed the object form when you only want to generate 1 element. It was confusing to be able to use both object and array.

  ```
  // previously
  // create a single user
  snaplet.User({})
  // create a user with a post
  snaplet.User({
    Post: {}
  })

  // from 0.69.0 onwards
  // create a single user
  snaplet.User([{}])
  // create a user with a post
  snaplet.User([{
    Post: [{}]
  }])
  ```

  Note that this is a 🚨 breaking change and you'll need to use aliases going forward.

  Questions? Come ask us for help on [Discord](https://app.snaplet.dev/chat).*
  </Step>
  <Step>
  ## 18 October 2023 - v0.68.0

  #### 🚨 Breaking Change: `pipe` and `merge`

  We've changed the signature for the `pipe` and `merge` operators to take in an array of plans instead of using variadic arguments for plans:

  ```
  // previously
  snaplet.$pipe(snaplet.User({}), snaplet.Post({}))
  snaplet.$merge(snaplet.User({}), snaplet.Post({}))
  snaplet.User({}).pipe(snaplet.Post({}))
  snaplet.User({}).merge(snaplet.Post({}))

  // from 0.68.1 onwards
  snaplet.$pipe([snaplet.User({}), snaplet.Post({})])
  snaplet.$merge([snaplet.User({}), snaplet.Post({}))
  snaplet.User({}).pipe([snaplet.Post({})])
  snaplet.User({}).merge([snaplet.Post({})])
  ```

  #### 🎁 New Feature: options supported for `pipe` and `merge` operators

  As you may expect, with this change, we now also support options to be provided for these operators in our Generate API.

  ```
  snaplet.$merge([/* ... plans */], {
    models: {
      Post: {
        data: {
          // This title will be used for all plans
          // being combined by this merge
          title: 'A title for posts in the merged plans'
        }
      }
    }
  })
  ```

  Options given to these operators will be passed down to the plans they are combining. If these plans provide their own options, they will take precedence over the corresponding pipe/merge options.

  #### 🐛 Bug fixes - Generate
  We were were not detecting identity columns correctly, and `generate` was not able to generate and insert rows for tables with identity columns. `Snaplet generate` is now able to correctly detect if it is dealing with an identity column, and uses `OVERRIDING SYSTEM VALUE` when outputting `INSERT` statements in order to work with these columns.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  ## 16 October 2023 - v0.67.0

  #### 🚨 Breaking Change: Better seeding values

  For Snaplet `generate` we've modified the `seed` values generated to be more logically consistent and aligned with users' expectations.

  By way of demonstration, before this release, the same id would be returned for these two users:

  ```
  await  snaplet.User({ email: 'alice@acme.com' })
  await snaplet.User({ email: 'bob@acme.com' })
  ```

  Doen't make much sense, right? This was because the seed value injected per column was only relying on your plan's paths (here the seed for the User's id would be `0/User/id`).

  We produce a hash based on the inputs you provide to `snaplet.<modelName>(inputs)` so the output will always depends on the inputs. It's the same behaviour as Snaplet [Copycat](https://github.com/snaplet/copycat), and we think it's more predictable and logical that way.

  #### 🎁 New Features: `generate` improvements

  We've added the `--output` option to `generate` so you can safely write the SQL statement to a file without being bothered by eventual other messages logged to stdout (like our auto upgrade message). [Read more](https://docs.snaplet.dev/reference/cli#generate-1).

  We've also added more ways of handling `tags` attached to a snapshot to the CLI. [Read more](https://docs.snaplet.dev/reference/cli).
  </Step>
  <Step>
## 12 October 2023 - v0.66.0

#### ✅ `Generate` in Beta

A major milestone for our `generate` feature, which officially enters beta status!

With this release, we have totally reworked the `generate` API so it can be both more powerful and flexible. It goes from alpha to beta status, and we'd love to hear your feedback!

If you've been using `generate` you'll need to migrate to use the latest version. We have a [migration guide here](https://docs.snaplet.dev/migrations/generate#from-0660-and-above).

Just getting started? If you want to know more about how to generate data you can refer to our [quick start guide](https://docs.snaplet.dev/getting-started/quick-start/generate) or our [`generate` core concept](https://docs.snaplet.dev/core-concepts/generate) page where we dig deeper into `generate` and its options.

Happy generating!
