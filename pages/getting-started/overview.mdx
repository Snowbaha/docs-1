# Overview

## What is Snaplet?

Snaplet is an **all-in-one developer tool** that gives developers **realistic, production-like data** that they can code against.

There are two ways to obtain production-like data with Snaplet: either by [capturing](/core-concepts/capture) an existing source database into a **snapshot**, or by [generating](/core-concepts/seed) fake data using AI.

### Snapshots
**Snapshots** are database snapshots [captured](/core-concepts/capture) from an existing database you can access (typically production). Snapshots can be [subset](/core-concepts/capture#subset-data) (reduced in size) and the source data can be [transformed](/core-concepts/capture#transform-data) to your requirements (for example, obfuscating personally identifiable information). Snapshots are restored into a database as part of your workflow, whether that's your local coding environment, a cloud environment, or CI/CD.

### Seed
If you don't have access to an existing database that has production or production-like data, Snaplet's [seed](/core-concepts/seed) feature allows you to create production-like fake data using AI.

## Quick Start
Want to dive right into Snaplet? Follow the [snapshot quick start](/getting-started/quick-start/snapshot) guide to get production-like data in your workflow.

If you don't have a database you can connect to, or would prefer to seed data using our AI seed feature, follow the [`seed` quick start guide](/getting-started/quick-start/seed) instead.

## Key Features

- **Seed data:** Create production-like fake data using AI.
- **Capture data:** Create a database snapshot from your existing database.
- **Restore data:** Code against your snapshot by restoring it to a database.
- **Share data:** Collaborate seamlessly by sharing your data on Snaplet Cloud.
- **Deploy data:** Instantly deploy your snapshot to a Preview Database.
- **Snaplet dev flow:** Like Git, but for data.
