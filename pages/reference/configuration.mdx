# The Snaplet Config File

Customize how Snaplet works by adding a `snaplet.config.ts` file in the root of your project.

A valid Snaplet config file exports its configuration using the default export, using the recommended `defineConfig` helper:

```ts snaplet.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet'

export default defineConfig({
  // your configuration options here...
})
```

The configuration object is broken down into multiple sections, following our core concepts, each with their own set of options.

### Introspect

There are situations where your database constraints are not enough to fully describe your data model, this is where the `introspect` section comes in to allow you to add additional information to help Snaplet understands your database structure.

For example, if you have a table with a relationship to another one, but the foreign key constraint is not defined in the database, you can use the `virtualForeignKeys` option to tell Snaplet about it:

```ts snaplet.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet'

export default defineConfig({
  introspect: {
    virtualForeignKeys: [
      {
        fkTable: 'public.Post',
        targetTable: 'public.User',
        keys: [{ fkColumn: 'authorId', targetColumn: 'id' }],
      },
    ],
  }
})
```

### Seed

If you don't have access to production data, or if you want to generate a fake dataset for development/testing purposes, you can use the `seed` section to define how Snaplet should generate your data.

For an in-depth guide on how to use the `seed` section, check out the [Seed](/core-concepts/seed) page.

### Capture

If you have access to production data, the following sections will allow you to customize how you want to capture your data.

#### Select

The `select` section allows you to filter which part of your database you want to capture.

```ts snaplet.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';

export default defineConfig({
  select: {
    // the archive schema won't be captured
    archive: false,
    public: {
      // the AuditLog table data won't be captured, but its structure will be
      AuditLog: 'structure',
    },
  },
});
```

For an in-depth guide on how to use the `select` section, check out the [Select data](/core-concepts/capture#select-data) page.

#### Transform

The `transform` section allows you to apply transformations to your data before it gets captured.

```ts snaplet.config.ts
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat'
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';

export default defineConfig({
  transform: {
    public: {
      User({ row }) {
        return {
          // anonymize the email address
          email: copycat.email(row.email),
        }
      },
    },
  },
});
```

For an in-depth guide on how to use the `transform` section, check out the [Transform data](/core-concepts/capture#transform-data) page.

#### Subset

The `subset` section allows you to capture only a fraction of your data while keeping your relationships intact.

```ts snaplet.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';

export default defineConfig({
  subset: {
    targets: [
      {
        // capture only 10% of the Post table
        table: 'public.Post',
        percent: 10,
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

## Type-safe configuration based on your database structure

Snaplet recommends generating your own types based on your database structure to have automatic IntelliSense in your IDE.
Editors like VSCode are able to read Snaplet's TypeScript type definitions and provide hints and autocompletion for your configuration.

To generate your own types, use the `snaplet config generate` command:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
snaplet config generate
```

This will generate multiple type declaration files under the `.snaplet` folder. You can then import these types in your config file using the triple-slash notation:

```ts snaplet.config.ts
// mark
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet'

// defineConfig now has full IntelliSense support based on your database structure
export default defineConfig({
  // your configuration options here...
})
```
