</Callout>

## The need for generated data

Generated data, or seed data, is a useful tool in software development, providing an initial set of data for your database.

Here's why it's beneficial:

- **Development:** Provides a consistent dataset for developers.
- **Testing:** Ensures predictability when verifying features.
- **Demonstration:** Showcases your software's abilities with example content.
- **Default Data:** Adds necessary built-ins, like country lists.
- **Onboarding:** Gives new users a filled-out starting point.
- **Performance:** Helps simulate heavy usage scenarios.
- **Guides:** Common reference in tutorials.

While generated data might be the unsung hero of early development, it can get a bit needy as software evolves. But don't sweat it! Our mission is to save you from the never-ending saga of maintaining those seed scripts. Who has time for that, right?

## The workflow at a glance

Using Snaplet to seed data will typically look something like this:

1. Initial setup with `npx snaplet setup`
2. Using `@snaplet/seed` to generate seed data
3. Regenerating assets as your database changes with `npx snaplet generate`

You can also refer to the [Seed Quick Start Guide](/getting-started/quick-start/seed) for a practical example of the workflow.

### 1. Initial setup with `npx snaplet setup`

At the start, you'll setup Snaplet for your project with `npx snaplet setup`, and follow the interactive prompts.

`snaplet setup` will look at your database and its structure, and use it to generate the configuration files and assets needed by `@snaplet/seed`.

### 2. Using `@snaplet/seed` to generate seed data

`@snaplet/seed` is what you'll use to _actually_ generate data. It is a javascript library, giving you a fully-typed programmatic interface tailored to your database structure, which you'll use to describe _how_ data should be generated.

Most commonly you'll write and run seed scripts that use `@snaplet/seed`. If you write your seed scripts in typescript, [tsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsx) might come in handy for running your scripts:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx tsx seed.mts
```

Writing and running vanilla javascript works too:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
# a vanilla javascript file that uses `@snaplet/seed`
node seed.js
```

You can also use `@snaplet/seed` in other scenarios - for example, in your tests.

For more detail on using `@snaplet/seed`, check out [Generating data with `@snaplet/seed`](#generating-data-with-snapletseed) below.

### 3. Regenerating assets as your database changes with `npx snaplet generate`

`@snaplet/seed` provides you with a client library that corresponds to your database structure. To do this, snaplet looks at your database structure and uses this to generate assets that `@snaplet/seed` can use to provide this client library.

Whenever your database structure changes, `@snaplet/seed` will need these assets to be regenerated so that they are in sync with your new database structure.

You can regenerate these assets by running:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx snaplet generate
```

If you are familiar with [`@prisma/client`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client), you can think of `snaplet generate` doing the same thing, just in this case for `@snaplet/seed` rather than `@prisma/client`.

## Generating data with `@snaplet/seed`

You can refer to the [Seed Quick Start Guide](/getting-started/quick-start/seed) to learn about the basics of `@snaplet/seed`.

For more, check out the [Seed Quick Start Guide](/getting-started/quick-start/seed).

### Inside the `@snaplet/seed` workflow

#### Deterministic data generation

The data generated by `@snaplet/seed` is fully deterministic, if you run the same plan twice with the same inputs, you will always get the same data as output.
Our default data generation functions are based on [copycat](https://github.com/snaplet/copycat).

The [operators](/core-concepts/seed#manipulating-stores) are injecting their own seed for each plan they wrap to ensure you won't have data duplication.
For example, these 2 users will have different values:

```ts
await snaplet.$merge([
  snaplet.users([{}]),
  snaplet.users([{}]),
]);
```

You can also use the `seed` option to specify a custom seed for a plan:

```ts
await snaplet.users([{
  id: ({ seed }) => seed,
  email: 'alice@acme.com'
}], { seed: 'hello' });

await snaplet.users([{
  id: ({ seed }) => seed,
  email: 'bob@acme.com'
}], { seed: 'world' });
```

#### Plans, stores and SQL statements

The **plan** is what's returned by the methods of `@snaplet/seed`. It's a representation of the data you want to seed.

```ts
const userPlan = snaplet.users([{ email: 'snappy@snaplet.dev' }]);
//    ^ the plan               ^ the plan's inputs
```

When a plan is executed, triggered by `await`ing the plan, it stores the generated data in an in-memory object called a **store**.
Each plan has its own store.
Then, the store is turned into **SQL statements** that are executed to persist the data in your database.

Given the plan from the [Seed Quick Start Guide](/getting-started/quick-start/seed):

```ts seed.mts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const snaplet = new SnapletClient();

await snaplet.posts([{
  title: 'Hello World!',
  author: {
    email: ({ seed }) =>
      copycat.email(seed, {
        domain: 'acme.org',
      }),
  },
  comments: (x) => x(3),
}]);
```

Here is what its store looks like internally:

```ts
const store = {
  users: [user, user, user, user],
  posts: [post],
  comments: [comment, comment, comment],
}
```

This store is very useful when you want to [connect](/core-concepts/seed#connecting-to-existing-data) your models, reusing existing data instead of generating new one.


### Static or dynamic data, we got you covered

If you want to use static data, you can directly pass an array to the models methods.
As always, all the required fields and relationships will be automatically created for you based on your database schema.

```ts
// an array of 2 users
snaplet.users([
  { email: 'alice@acme.com' },
  { email: 'bob@acme.com' },
]);
```

If you want to use dynamic data, you can pass a callback function to the models methods. We inject a function `x` that you can use to generate as many models as you want.

```ts
// an array of 10 users
snaplet.users((x) => x(10));

// an array of 10 users with a custom email
snaplet.users((x) => x(10, (index) => ({
  email: `user${index}@snaplet.dev`,
})));
```

And if you need both static and dynamic data, you can mix them together!

```ts
// an array of 10 users
snaplet.users((x) => [
  { email: 'first@acme.com' },
  ...x(8),
  { email: 'last@acme.com' },
])
```

### Connecting data

#### Using `connect` callback function

<CH.Scrollycoding className="seed-tutorial-configuration-file">

Let's start from our previous plan.

```ts seed.mts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat';

const snaplet = new SnapletClient();

await snaplet.posts([{
  title: 'Hello World!',
  author: {
    email: ({ seed }) =>
      copycat.email(seed, {
        domain: 'acme.org',
      }),
  },
  comments: (x) => x(3),
}]);
```

---

We specify that the author of each comment will be provided from an external source rather than being generated using the `connect` callback function.

```ts seed.mts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat';

const snaplet = new SnapletClient()

await snaplet.posts([{
  title: 'Hello World!',
  author: {
    email: ({ seed }) =>
      copycat.email(seed, {
        domain: 'acme.org',
      }),
  },
  comments: (x) => x(3, () => ({
    // focus(1:3)
    author: () => {

    }
  })),
}]);
```

---

We can use the injected `store` to provide the `user` model we want to connect to. In this case the only generated `user` in the plan will be the author of the post.

```ts seed.mts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat';

await snaplet.posts([{
  title: 'Hello World!',
  author: {
    email: ({ seed }) =>
      copycat.email(seed, {
        domain: 'acme.org',
      }),
  },
  comments: (x) => x(3, () => ({
    // focus(1:3)
    author: ({ store }) => {
      return store.users[0];
    }
  })),
}]);
```

</CH.Scrollycoding>

##### `graph`

If your plan is complex, it can be quite challenging to find the right model to connect to. That's why we also provide the `graph` variable to the `connect` function.

The `graph` contains all the data that was generated as part of the plan, arranged to follow the shape of your plan.

And here is how you can use it:

```ts seed.mts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat';

const snaplet = new SnapletClient()

await snaplet.posts([{
  title: 'Hello World!',
  author: {
    email: ({ seed }) => copycat.email(seed, { domain: 'acme.org' }),
  },
  comments: (x) => x(3, () => ({
    // focus(1:4)
    // we alias the graph to posts to make it more readable
    author: ({ graph: posts }) => {
      return posts[0].author;
    }
  })),
}]);
```

Here is what the `graph` looks like for this plan:

```ts
// as we started with snaplet.posts, the graph is an array of posts
const graph = [
  {
    author: user,
    comments: [
      comment,
      comment,
      comment,
    ],
  },
];
```

##### `branch`

Now let's complexify our plan a bit:

- We want to generate 3 posts.
- The author of each post should also be the author of the post's comments.

It seems challenging to find the right user to connect to using `store` or `graph`. That's why we also provide the `branch` variable to the `connect` function.

The `branch` is a particular iteration of the `graph` that was generated. It matches the path to the `connect` function in which it is injected.

Let's take a look at the `branch` for our previous plan, adapted to our new requirements:

```ts seed.mts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat';

const snaplet = new SnapletClient()

await snaplet.posts([{
  title: 'Hello World!',
  author: {
    email: ({ seed }) => copycat.email(seed, { domain: 'acme.org' }),
  },
  comments: (x) => x(3, () => ({
    // focus(1:4)
    // we alias the branch to "post" to make it more readable
    author: ({ branch: post }) => {
      return post.author;
    }
  })),
}]);
```

Generating 3 posts will result in 3 branches, each containing a post, its author and its comments.

In our above example, the `connect` function will receive the branch corresponding to its iteration. So the first `connect` function will receive the first branch, the second `connect` function will receive the second branch, and so on.

Here is what the `branch` looks like for this particular `connect` function:

```ts
// as we started with snaplet.posts, the branch is a post model
const branch = {
  author: user,
  comments: [comment],
};
```

#### Using `autoConnect` option

We provide a special option that you can activate in the options of a plan, called `autoConnect`.

When `true`, the plan will automatically connect models relationships to fulfill to the store if possible. The corresponding model will be picked randomly (but deterministically, we're using `copycat.oneOf` method under the hood).

In the following example, the `post` model will be connected to one of the 3 `users` in the store.

```ts seed.mts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const snaplet = new SnapletClient()

await snaplet.$pipe([
  snaplet.users((x) => x(3)),
  // mark
  snaplet.posts([{}], { autoConnect: true })
]);
```

#### Augmenting external data with `$createStore`

Sometimes, you want to augment external data with generated data. For example, you might want to generate 10 `posts` for a particular `user` in your database.

For this purpose, we provide the `$createStore` utility function. It allows you to create a store and pass it as a plan's option:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client"
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const prisma = new PrismaClient();
const snaplet = new SnapletClient()

const user = await prisma.users.findUnique({ where: { email: 'alice@acme.com' } });

const store = snaplet.$createStore({
  users: [user]
});

// The 10 posts will be connected to the unique user in the store
await snaplet.posts((x) => x(10), { autoConnect: true, store });
```

When using `$createStore`, the data are marked as external, and won't be persisted in the database. Only the generated data will be persisted.

You can use the `external` option if you want the data to be persisted:

```ts
// the initial data is not marked as external and will be persisted
const store = snaplet.$createStore({
  users: [user]
}, { external: false });

// we add another user to the store, this time marked as external.
// You can omit the external option, it defaults to true.
store.add('users', anotherUser, { external: true });
```

### Manipulating stores

We saw that a **plan** is persisting the generated data in a **store**, and the store will be turned into **SQL statements**.

Sometimes, it's easier to break down your plan into multiple plans, and then merge them together. That's why we provide the `$pipe` and `$merge` functions.

#### Using `$pipe`

The `$pipe` operator allows you to chain multiple plans together, injecting the `store` of the previous plan into the next plan.

```ts seed.mts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const snaplet = new SnapletClient()

await snaplet.$pipe([
  snaplet.users((x) => x(3)),
  snaplet.posts([{
    author: ({ store }) => {
      // this is the first user generated by the previous plan
      return store.users[0];
    }
  }])
]);
```

#### Using `$merge`

The `$merge` operator allows you to merge multiple plans together, without injecting the `store` of the previous plan into the next plan.
All stores stay independent and are merged together once all the plans are generated.

```ts seed.mts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const snaplet = new SnapletClient()

await snaplet.$merge([
  snaplet.users((x) => x(3)),
  snaplet.posts([{}]),
  snaplet.comments((x) => x(2))
]);
```

## Customizing `@snaplet/seed` with aliases

The models, fields and relationships names are fully customizable. You can use the `alias` option to change them.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You need to regenerate your types after changing the alias option.

  To do that, run this command in your terminal:
  ```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
  SNAPLET_SOURCE_DATABASE_URL='postgres://username:password@acme.com:5432/your_database' npx snaplet config generate --type typedefs
  ```
</Callout>

### Inflection

Inflection generally refers to the modification of words to express different grammatical categories.
In our context, inflection is about altering the form of a model, field or relationship name to fit its intended use or to adhere to certain conventions so your code is more readable.

You can use the `inflection` option to provide your own rules to define the names of your models, fields and relationships.

We provide a default and sensible implementation of the inflection rules, inspired by [PostGraphile](https://github.com/graphile/pg-simplify-inflector#graphile-contribpg-simplify-inflector), but you can override them if you want.

These rules are:

- **Model names:** pluralized and camelCased.
- **Scalar field names:** camelCased.
- **Parent field names (one to one relationships):** singularized and camelCased.
- **Child field names (one to many relationships):** pluralized and camelCased.
- We also support [prefix extraction and opposite baseName for foreign keys](https://github.com/graphile/pg-simplify-inflector#naming-your-foreign-key-fields).

Given your tables being named `User`, `Post` and `Comment`, here is an example of how you can use the `inflection` option to change the names of your models:

```ts seed.mts
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';

export default defineConfig({
  seed: {
    alias: {
      // enable our standard inflection rules
      inflection: true,
    },
  }
});
```

```ts seed.mts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const snaplet = new SnapletClient()

// without inflection, you would have to use snaplet.User(...)
await snaplet.users((x) => x(3))
```

And here is how you would change the inflection rules:

```ts seed.mts
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';

export default defineConfig({
  seed: {
    alias: {
      inflection: {
        modelName: (modelName) => `Super${modelName}s`,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

```ts seed.mts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const snaplet = new SnapletClient()

// without inflection, you would have to use snaplet.User(...)
await snaplet.SuperUsers((x) => x(3))
```

### Override

If you are not satisfied with the default names of your models, fields or relationships, but you only want to do one-off changes, you can use the `override` option.

```ts snaplet.config.ts
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';

export default defineConfig({
  seed: {
    alias: {
      inflection: true,
      override: {
        User: {
          fields: {
            Post_Post_validator_idToUser: 'validatedPosts',
          }
        }
      }
    },
  },
});
```

```ts seed.mts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const snaplet = new SnapletClient()

await snaplet.users([{
  // without override, it would be: postsByValidatorId: [...]
  validatedPosts: [{ title: 'Hello World!' }]
}])
```

The `override` option is applied on top of the `inflection` option, it's perfect for one-off changes.
