## Generate data for your Supabase local development stack

Supabase makes it easy to set up a local development environment linked to your Supabase project. Snaplet can improve your local development by seeding your local database with data, making coding and testing more efficient and accurate.

In this short guide, we use the `snaplet seed` command to seed a local Supabase stack. We will use the [Nextjs + Supabase template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/supabase) as an example.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Supabase CLI installed](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started)
- [Snaplet CLI installed](/seed/getting-started/installation)

#### 1. Clone the Nextjs + Supabase template

**1.1.** Create a Next.js app using the starter template by running the `npx` command:

```bash
npx create-next-app -e with-supabase
```

**1.2.** Use `cd` to change into the newly created directory:

```bash
cd name-of-new-app
```

#### 2. Setup your Supabase project and apply migrations

**2.1.** Initialize the configuration for your Supabase local development project.

```bash
supabase init
```

**2.2.** Start your Supabase local stack. This will run the latest migrations against your local database.

```bash
supabase start
```

This command will print out the following output:

```bash
Started supabase local development setup.

         API URL: http://localhost:54321
          DB URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
      Studio URL: http://localhost:54323
    Inbucket URL: http://localhost:54324
        anon key: eyJh......
service_role key: eyJh......
```

#### 3. Set up your Snaplet seed config

**3.1.** Initialise `@snaplet/seed` in your your root project.

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx @snaplet/seed init
```

**3.2.** Update the `seed.mts` file to create 10 users and 20 todos, the todos should be assigned to at least one of the 10 users.

```ts seed.mts
// create 10 users
await seed.users((x) => x(10));
// create 20 todos, for each of the 10 users
await seed.todos((x) => x(20), { connect: true });
```

You are now ready to seed your database.

#### 4. Reset and seed your local development database

**4.1** Run `npx tsx seed.mts` and pipe the output to your `supabase/seed.sql` file.

```bash
npx tsx seed.mts > supabase/seed.sql
```

**4.2** Reset your local development database. This will run all the existing migrations and apply the seed script (at `supabase/seed.sql`).

```bash
supabase db reset
```

**4.3** Check your local database to see if the result of your seed script.

Now if you visit the Supabase Studio URL hosted locally (http://localhost:54323) and inspect the **"todo"** table, you should see 20 todo items.

In your project folder, if you move `app/_examples/client-component/page.tsx` to `app/todos/page.tsx` and then visit `http://localhost:3000/todos` you should see all the todos created.

### All done!

You have now successfully seeded your Supabase local development stack. As well as use the `snaplet seed` command to seed your local database with the data you need.
