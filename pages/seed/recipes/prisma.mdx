# Prisma

> Learn how to add a `seed.mts` to your project, using our [quick start](/seed/getting-started/quick-start) guide.

Prisma Migrations creates the database structure, Snaplet seed requires to generate data against.

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
prisma migrate dev && npx tsx seed.mts
```

If you don't want to run two commands, you can automatically seed the database with data, after running `prisma migrate reset` or `prisma migrate dev`, by adding the following to your `package.json` file.

```json package.json
"prisma": {
  "seed": "npx tsx seed.mts"
}
```

Learn ["how to seed your database in Prisma"](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/database/seed-database#how-to-seed-your-database-in-prisma) from their documentation.

### Note on Migrations

Whenever your database structure changes (e.g after a new migration is applied), `@snaplet/seed` will need be regenerated to reflect the new structure. To do this, run the following command:
```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx @snaplet/seed dev
```
