# What is Seed?

**Seed** is a set of tools **understanding your database schema** to help you **generate production-accurate data**.

It consists of the following parts:

- **Seed ORM**: Auto-generated and type-safe data client for Node.js & TypeScript 🛡️
- **Seed CLI**: A CLI to generate and keep the data client in sync with your database 🛠️
- **Seed AI**: Our custom model identifying the shape of your data 🤖

## Seed ORM

To generate data, we don't need the details, you can focus on the data that matters to **you**.
We will take care of generating all the relationships for you. ✨

Are you working on a blog app and need 5 posts?
```ts
await seed.posts((x) => x(5))
```

Or maybe you need a user with a specific email?
```ts
await seed.users([
  { email: 'snappy@snaplet.dev' },
])
```

What if you want to create an organization with a varying number of members?
```ts
await seed.organizations([
  {
    name: 'Snaplet',
    members: (x) => x({ min: 1, max: 10 }),
  },
])
```

## Seed CLI

It's the entry point to Seed. It will help you generate the data client and keep it in sync with your database.

Start using Seed in seconds by running this command in your project directory:
```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx @snaplet/seed init
```

## Seed AI

We are using AI to have a deeper understand of your datatabase schema so we can generate the most accurate and production-like data for you.
