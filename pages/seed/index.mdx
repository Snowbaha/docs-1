# What is Seed?

**Seed** is a set of tools **understanding your database schema** to help you **generate production-accurate data**.

It consists of the following parts:

- **Seed ORM**: Auto-generated and type-safe data client for Node.js & TypeScript 🛡️
- **Seed AI**: Our custom model identifying the shape of your data 🤖
- **Seed CLI**: A CLI to generate and keep the data client in sync with your database 🛠️

## Seed ORM

To generate data, we don't need the details, you can focus on the data that matters to **you**.
We will take care of generating all the relationships for you. ✨

Are you working on a blog app and need 5 posts?
```ts
await seed.posts((x) => x(5))
```

Or maybe you need a user with a specific email?
```ts
await seed.users([
  { email: 'snappy@snaplet.dev' },
])
```

What if you want to create an organization with a varying number of members?
```ts
await seed.organizations([
  {
    name: 'Snaplet',
    members: (x) => x({ min: 1, max: 10 }),
  },
])
```
