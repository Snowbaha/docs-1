# What is Seed?

**Seed** is a set of tools **understanding your database schema** to help you **generate production-accurate data**.

It consists of the following parts:

- **Seed ORM**: Auto-generated and type-safe data client for Node.js & TypeScript 🛡️
- **Seed CLI**: A CLI to generate and keep the data client in sync with your database 🛠️
- **Seed AI**: Our custom model identifying the shape of your data 🤖

We are compatible with [PostgreSQL]() and [SQLite](). MySQL support is coming soon.

## Seed ORM

Our data client is auto-generated from your database schema.
We are using the full power of TypeScript to provide you with a type-safe and auto-completed experience when working with your data.

You can focus on the data that matter to **you**, we will take care of generating all the relationships. ✨

Here is a sneak peek of what you can do with Seed ORM:

Are you working on a blog app and need 5 posts?
```ts
await seed.posts((x) => x(5))
```

Or maybe you need a user with a specific email?
```ts
await seed.users([
  { email: 'snappy@snaplet.dev' },
])
```

What if you want to create an organization with a varying number of members?
```ts
await seed.organizations([
  {
    name: 'Snaplet',
    members: (x) => x({ min: 1, max: 10 }),
  },
])
```

And this is just the beginning! Explore the [Seed ORM guide]() to see all the possibilities.
