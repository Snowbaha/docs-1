# Overview

## What is Snaplet?

Snaplet is an **all-in-one developer tool** that gives developers **realistic, production-like data** that they can code against.

There are two ways to obtain production-like data with Snaplet: either by [capturing](/snapshot/core-concepts/capture) an existing source database into a **snapshot**, or by [generating](/seed/core-concepts) fake data using AI.

### Seed
If you don't have access to an existing database that has production or production-like data, Snaplet's [seed](/core-concepts/seed) feature allows you to create production-like fake data using AI.

## Quick Start

Follow the [`seed` quick start](/getting-started/quick-start/seed) to get seed data using AI. This is the recommended path if you don't have a database you can connect to. If you do have access to a database and want production-like data, check out our [snapshot quick start](/getting-started/quick-start/snapshot) guide.
