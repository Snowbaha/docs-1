# Overview

Snaplet **seed** uses **your database schema** to generate **production-accurate data** for use in local development or testing. 

Seed consists of the following components:

- **Seed CLI**: A CLI to generate and keep the data client in sync with your database 🛠️
- **Seed Client**: Auto-generated and type-safe data client for Node.js & TypeScript 🛡️
- **Seed AI**: Our custom model identifying the shape of your data 🤖

**Seed** is compatible with [PostgreSQL](../reference/adapters.mdx#postgres) and [SQLite](../reference/adapters.mdx#sqlite). MySQL support is coming soon.

## Seed CLI

The **seed** CLI is the entry point to the Snaplet **seed** experience. It generates the **seed** data client, and keeps it in sync with your database.

To begin your journey with **seed**, run this command in your project directory:
```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx @snaplet/seed init
```

Checkout the [seed CLI reference](../reference/cli.mdx) to learn more about the CLI and how to use it.

## Seed Client

Once the CLI has generated the **seed** data client from your database schema, you can start generating production-accurate data for your development needs. 

The **seed** client uses TypeScript, which ensures a type-safe and auto-completed experience when working with your data, allowing you to validate data transformations as you're defining the data you want. 

Additionally, because **seed** uses your schema, it understands the intricacies of your data and its relationships, and is able to generate highly realistic data sets with minimal input. As an example, here's what you can do with the **seed** client:

Let's assume you've created a blog application, and now need 5 posts' worth of data. Here's how to get that from the **seed** client: 
```ts
await seed.posts((x) => x(5))
```

Perhaps you need a user with a specific email address for testing purposes: 
```ts
await seed.users([
  { email: 'snappy@snaplet.dev' },
])
```

And maybe you need an small organization with a random amount of members, but fewer than 10:
```ts
await seed.organizations([
  {
    name: 'Snaplet',
    members: (x) => x({ min: 1, max: 10 }),
  },
])
```
What might require dozens of lines of code in a traditional seed script are achieved in just a few statements here. 

Because Snaplet **seed** understands the structure of your data and is able to infer the probable relationships between entities, it's able to construct a comprehensive graph of related entities and populate your database with highly realistic data. 

## Seed AI

The **seed** AI-powered prediction API enables a deeper understanding of your datatabase schema. This in turn means **seed** is able to suggest the most accurate and production-like data for your use case, reducing manual workload.
