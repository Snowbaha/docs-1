Snaplet gives you two options for getting data into your Supabase public schema. Pick your own path:

- [Generate data for your Supabase local development stack](/recipes/supabase#seeding-a-supabase-local-development-stack)
- [Restore data from your production Supabase project to your local development stack](/recipes/supabase#restoring-to-a-supabase-local-development-stack)

<Callout>
For restoring and seeding data into your Supabase project, only the `public` and `auth` schemas are supported. If you experience any issues with any of the paths, reach out to us on [Discord](https://app.snaplet.dev/chat).

## Generate data for your Supabase local development stack

Supabase makes it easy to set up a local development environment linked to your Supabase project. Snaplet can improve your local development by seeding your local database with data, making coding and testing more efficient and accurate.

In this short guide, we use the `snaplet seed` command to seed a local Supabase stack. We will use the [Nextjs + Supabase template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/supabase) as an example.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Supabase CLI installed](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started)
- [Snaplet CLI installed](/getting-started/installation)

#### 1. Clone the Nextjs + Supabase template

**1.1.** Create a Next.js app using the starter template by running the `npx` command:

```bash
npx create-next-app -e with-supabase
```

**1.2.** Use `cd` to change into the newly created directory:

```bash
cd name-of-new-app
```

#### 2. Setup your Supabase project and apply migrations

**2.1.** Initialize the configuration for your Supabase local development project.

```bash
supabase init
```

**2.2.** Start your Supabase local stack. This will run the latest migrations against your local database.

```bash
supabase start
```

This command will print out the following output:

```bash
Started supabase local development setup.

         API URL: http://localhost:54321
          DB URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
      Studio URL: http://localhost:54323
    Inbucket URL: http://localhost:54324
        anon key: eyJh......
service_role key: eyJh......
```

**2.3.** Copy the DB URL - we will use this in the next step **(step 4)** to generate data into (referred to as the target database).

#### 3. Set up your Snaplet seed config

**3.1.** Create a `seed.mts` file in your root directory.

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx snaplet setup
```

```bash >_&nbsp; terminal
# mark
✔ Welcome to Snaplet! 😸 Choose your adventure: › I want to generate seed data 🌱

# mark
✔ Target database connection string … postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres

# mark
✔ Database URL … postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres

# mark
✔ Would you like to link your account from Snaplet Cloud to have more realistic data using our AI model? 🤖 … no

For the best AI-enhanced data generation experience, create a free Snaplet account and login with: snaplet auth login.

Snaplet uses details about your database to improve our generation results.

✔ You're all set!

📝 Edit your seed script:
You can describe how you would like to generate seed data by editing the example seed script:
code seed.mts

👁️  Preview seed statements:
You can take a look at the sql statements that can be generated with:
npx tsx seed.mts

✨ Apply seeds:
To load the generated data into your database execute the command:
DRY=0 npx tsx seed.mts
```

**3.2.** Update the `seed.mts` file to create 10 users and 20 todos, the todos should be assigned to at least one of the 10 users.

```ts seed.mts
// create 10 users
await seed.users((x) => x(10));
// create 20 todos, for each of the 10 users
seed.todos((x) => x(20), { connect: true });
```

You are now ready to seed your database.

#### 4. Reset and seed your local development database

**4.1** Run `npx tsx seed.mts` and pipe the output to your `supabase/seed.sql` file.

```bash
npx tsx seed.mts > supabase/seed.sql
```

**4.2** Reset your local development database. This will run all the existing migrations and apply the seed script (at `supabase/seed.sql`).

```bash
supabase db reset
```

**4.3** Check your local database to see if the result of your seed script.

Now if you visit the Supabase Studio URL hosted locally (http://localhost:54323) and inspect the **"todo"** table, you should see 20 todo items.

![20 todos in the studio dashboard](/recipes/supabase/20_todos.webp)

In your project folder, if you move `app/_examples/client-component/page.tsx` to `app/todos/page.tsx` and then visit `http://localhost:3000/todos` you should see all the todos created.

### All done!

You have now successfully seeded your Supabase local development stack. As well as use the `snaplet seed` command to seed your local database with the data you need.

## Restoring to a Supabase local development stack

Supabase makes it easy to start a project with a dedicated PostgreSQL database. However, achieving a development environment populated with data closely resembling producation, still requires some set up.
This guide will help you restore a snapshot of your production database into your local development stack.

#### 1. Connect your source database (Production Database)

Navigate to https://www.snaplet.dev and sign up for a new account (it's free). Once you have successfully signed up for a new account, you'll begin the onboarding process...

![Snaplet onboarding select team name](/recipes/supabase/onboarding_start.webp)

On the “Connect database” step click on "Connect Supabase" to connect your Supabase account to Snaplet. Proceed through all the steps of authorizing your Supabase organization, select a project and then enter the password associated to the project.

![Snaplet onboarding connect your database](/recipes/supabase/connect_to_supabase.webp)

> The snapshot configuration generated during onboarding will be set to only capture the `public` and `auth` schemas. Learn more [below](#excluding-specific-schemas-from-snapshots).

#### 2: Create a snapshot

Continue to the next steps:

- Subsetting (skipping will create a snapshot with all your data).
- Transforming (skipping will leave all your table columns untouched).

Once you have gone through all these steps, a new snapshot process will start and you will now be on the “capture step.” Wait for it to finish - this is the snapshot you will restore into your **target database.**

![Snaplet onboarding capturing your database](/recipes/supabase/onboarding_capture.webp)

#### 3: Set up your Supabase local development stack

Below is a summary of commands you will have to run in your terminal to get Supabase set up on your local machine. For more detailed steps you can visit the Supabase docs [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development).

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
# log in to the Supabase CLI
supabase login

# initialize your Supabase configuration in your project folder
supabase init

# with docker running, start your Supabase services
supabase start
```

Running `supabase start` will output your Supabase credentials, copy the **DB_URL** field, as we will paste it in your `snaplet.config.ts` file (step 5).

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
Started supabase local development setup.

         API URL: http://localhost:54321
          DB URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
      Studio URL: http://localhost:54323
    Inbucket URL: http://localhost:54324
        anon key: eyJh......
service_role key: eyJh......
```

#### 4: Install the Snaplet CLI

1. Open your terminal and run `curl -sL https://app.snaplet.dev/get-cli/ | bash`
2. Run `snaplet auth login`
3. Navigate to `https://app.snaplet.dev/access-token/cli` to get your access token.
4. Paste the access token in the terminal.

#### 5: Config setup

1. Navigate to your project directory.

2. Set up your snaplet config.

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
snaplet setup
```

```bash >_&nbsp; terminal
# mark
✔ Welcome to Snaplet! 😸 Choose your adventure: › I want to capture or restore a snapshot 💾

Target database credentials
Snaplet restores data to your target database using the target database credentials.

You're all set! Take a look at our docs to find out what you can do from here:
https://docs.snaplet.dev/getting-started/start-here/

Restore latest snapshot:
To restore the latest snapshot in your project execute the command:
snaplet ss restore --latest

Local capture:
You can learn more about self hosting here: https://docs.snaplet.dev/guides/self-hosting

To capture a snapshot of your local database first pull the full configuration with:
snaplet config pull

Then capture the snapshot with:
SNAPLET_SOURCE_DATABASE_URL=<database-url> snaplet ss capture
```

#### 6: Restore the data target

You are now ready to restore!

1. Run `snaplet snapshot restore` in your project path.

> **Note:** for supabase projects we automatically include the `--no-reset` flag when running `snaplet snapshot restore`. So no existing schemas will be dropped. Learn more about data operations [here](/core-concepts/capture)

![Supabase is fun!](/recipes/supabase/snappy-with-supabase-ball.svg)

### All done!

If you want to learn more about Snaplet, you can explore our docs. If you have any questions, reach out to us on [Discord](https://app.snaplet.dev/chat).

That's it! You're all done, and should have restored a version of your Supabase production database with transformed data into your target database. You can now code against production-realistic data.

### Troubleshooting

#### Excluding specific schemas from snapshots

Snaplet does not support restoring all the schemas in a Supabase instance. By default your config will be set to only capture the `public` and `auth` schemas. 
You can manually include other schemas, but this is not a supported use case for this integration.

> Schemas such as `storage` and `supabase_functions` schemas are excluded, because Snaplet is unable to also the clone the infrastructure required to support these schemas.

Your snapshot config should look something like this:

```ts snaplet.config.ts
defineConfig({
  select: {
    $default: false,
    public: true,
    auth: true,
    // you can manually include schemas here, e.g: when you enable an extension and that
    // extension creates a schema. Note: including any other schemas other than the "public"
    // and "auth" schemas, may break the state of your Supabase project.
  }
})
```

During onboarding, this `select` option is automatically added to your config. In the web editor you will be shown a warning, if you choose to remove the `$default` field.

#### Reset supabase database

Use the `supabase db reset` command to reset the state of your Supabase project. 
This is useful for cases a snapshot breaks your project, or you want to start from a clean slate.

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
# reset your supabase database
supabase db reset

# restore your snapshot
supabase snapshot restore
```
